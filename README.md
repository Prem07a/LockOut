# 🔓 Datonis Unlock Tool - Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows you to **unlock pages or functions** on the [Datonis platform](https://quality.datonis.io) directly from the browser. It works by detecting if you're on a supported `edit` URL, and sends a `POST` request to unlock the resource.
