## 🎯 How It Works

When you encounter a page or function that's locked by someone else:
1. Navigate to the locked page/function edit screen
2. Click the extension icon and hit **"Lock it to me"**
3. The lock gets reassigned from them to you
4. You can now edit it freely!

## 📌 Notes

* Make sure you're logged in, as the extension relies on your session cookies.
* This does **not** store any data or require special permissions beyond the domain.
* Use responsibly - only override locks when you genuinely need to edit the content.
